# DarkCityScape_mIOU_mPA
This is a repository for calculating the mIOU (mean intersection over union) and mPA (mean average precision) for DarkCityScapes. DarkCityScapes is the "Dark version" of the CityScape dataset and is specifically designed for extreme low-light image enhancement tasks. 
The dataset is simulated using gamma correction on 150 CityScape validation images. 

# Get Started
Firstly, download the DarkCityScape dataset from [Baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1--xG3uNuH_9rKzcHpQKqgQ) with [password](wvhy)

Secondly, put the predicted outcome (i.e., model output map) in


And the Groudtruth in 

Finally, run the following script 
'python main.py'

Following is the result table from some state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement models
